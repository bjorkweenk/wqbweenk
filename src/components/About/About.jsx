                <p id="intro"> Hi, Welcome! <br></br><br></br>
                    Waking up with a little breeze, some sunshine and a cup of coffee in my hand. <br></br>
                    I would say that would be my perfect start of the day. I dislike if there is not a new challenge. <br></br><br></br> Walking in the mountain, inline skating in the park or sweating in the gym. All those activities will give me a smile. <br></br><br></br>
                    Getting to know new people, developing new skills and exploring new countries will make me enthusiastic. <br></br>
                    and last but not least being surrounded by the people I love & doing a job that challenges me, is my key to happiness.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    Nice to meet you! <br></br>
                    Kind regards,
                </p>

                " After working in the hospitality sector, I have decided to explore the wonderful world called Web Development. I am loving it!
                During Covid19 and being stuck at my house, I started following different webinars. When I followed the free webinar of SheCodes, I was sold. From that moment I knew I wanted to continue with my journey of coding."
